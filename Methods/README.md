# Methods in C# – Basic Arithmetic Operations

This C# console application demonstrates how to create and use methods that return values. The program performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, multiplication, and division.

## 🧠 Purpose

- Understand how to define and call methods that return values
- Learn method overloading with different return types (e.g. `int`, `double`)
- Practise working with parameters in methods

## 📋 What It Does

- Defines and uses three methods:
  - `Add(int x, int y)` – Returns the sum of two integers
  - `Mult(int num1, int num2)` – Returns the product of two integers
  - `Div(double num3, double num4)` – Returns the quotient of two doubles
- Outputs the result of each operation to the console

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Language: C#
- Framework: .NET 6 / .NET Core
