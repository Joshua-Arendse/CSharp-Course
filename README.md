# C# Practice Projects ‚Äì Beginner Console Apps

This repository contains a collection of beginner-level C# console applications. Each project was created while learning fundamental programming concepts in C#. The goal is to practise syntax, understand the basics of programming, and build a strong foundation for more advanced software development.

## üìÅ Project List

| Project Name              | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `HelloWorld`              | Basic program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.                   |
| `BeepApp`                 | Uses `Console.Beep()` to demonstrate simple sound output.                   |
| `Var1`                    | Shows how to declare, assign, and use various numeric types and variables.  |
| `Var2`                    | Demonstrates string manipulation including `.ToUpper()`.                    |
| `Conversion`              | Demonstrates implicit, explicit, and string type conversions.               |
| `ParsingString`           | Parses strings into numbers using `int.Parse()` and `float.Parse()`.        |
| `DatatypesAndVariables`   | Declares and outputs various C# data types including byte, int, string, etc.|
| `StringManipulation`      | Covers concatenation, formatting, interpolation, and verbatim strings.      |
| `StringMethods`           | Demonstrates string methods like `.ToUpper()`, `.ToLower()`, `.Trim()`, etc.|
| `StringMethods2`          | Finds characters in strings and concatenates first and last names.          |
| `VoidMethods`             | Contains methods that print to the console without returning a value.       |
| `Methods`                 | Demonstrates basic arithmetic in return-type methods.                       |
| `MethodChallenge`         | Reuses a method to greet several names, showing method reusability.         |
| `UserInput`               | Takes two user inputs, converts them to integers, and returns their sum.    |
| `IfStatements`            | Basic `if`, `else-if`, and `else` statements using user input for temperature. |
| `TryParse`                | Safely parses user input for temperature using `int.TryParse()`.            |
| `NestedIfStatements`      | Demonstrates nesting of `if` statements and logical operators.              |
| `IfStatementsLogin`       | Basic username and password registration and login using conditionals.      |
| `TernaryOperatorChallenge`| Uses nested ternary operators to describe temperature ranges.               |
| `SwitchStatement`         | Uses `switch-case` statements with both numbers and strings.                |
| `SwitchCaseHighScore`     | Compares new scores with the high score and updates if needed.              |
| `EnhancedIfStatement`     | Uses both traditional `if-else` and ternary operators for logic flow.       |
| `Operators`               | Demonstrates arithmetic, unary, relational, equality, and logical operators.|
| `TryCatchAndFinally`      | Uses `try`, `catch`, and `finally` to handle exceptions like format errors or divide-by-zero. |
| `ForLoop`                 | Demonstrates `for` loops with basic counting, custom steps, and odd number iteration. |
| `DoWhileLoop`             | Uses a `do-while` loop to collect names until a total character length threshold is met. |
| `whileLoop`               | Increments a people counter until the user types a non-empty string.        |
| `BreakContinue`           | Demonstrates `break` to exit and `continue` to skip loop iterations.        |
| `LoopsChallenge`          | Gathers student scores between 1‚Äì20, then calculates and displays the average. |
