## üìÅ Project List

| Project Name           | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `HelloWorld`           | Basic program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.                   |
| `BeepApp`              | Uses `Console.Beep()` to demonstrate simple sound output.                   |
| `Var1`                 | Shows how to declare, assign, and use various numeric types and variables.  |
| `Var2`                 | Demonstrates string manipulation including `.ToUpper()`.                    |
| `Conversion`           | Demonstrates implicit, explicit, and string type conversions.               |
| `ParsingString`        | Parses strings into numbers using `int.Parse()` and `float.Parse()`.        |
| `DatatypesAndVariables`| Declares and outputs various C# data types including byte, int, string, etc.|
| `StringManipulation`   | Covers concatenation, formatting, interpolation, and verbatim strings.      |
| `StringMethods`        | Demonstrates string methods like `.ToUpper()`, `.ToLower()`, `.Trim()`, etc.|
| `StringMethods2`       | Finds characters in strings and concatenates first and last names.          |
| `VoidMethods`          | Contains methods that print to the console without returning a value.       |
| `Methods`              | Demonstrates basic arithmetic in return-type methods.                       |
| `MethodChallenge`      | Reuses a method to greet several names, showing method reusability.         |
| `UserInput`            | Takes two user inputs, converts them to integers, and returns their sum.    |
