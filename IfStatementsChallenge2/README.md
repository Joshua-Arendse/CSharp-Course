# PartyEligibility â€“ Age-Based Club Access

This is a simple C# console program that checks whether a user is allowed to go to a party in a club based on their age and whether they're accompanied by their parents.

## ðŸŽ¯ What It Does

- Asks the user for their age.
- Grants or denies access to a club based on the following logic:
  - **18 and older**: Full access.
  - **13 to 17**: Allowed only if with parents.
  - **Below 13**: Denied access.

## ðŸ”„ Logic Breakdown

```text
if age >= 18 â†’ "Go party in the club!"
else if age >= 13
    â†’ ask "Are you with your parents?"
    if yes â†’ "Go party in the club with your parents!"
    if no  â†’ "No party for you today!"
else â†’ "No party for you!"
