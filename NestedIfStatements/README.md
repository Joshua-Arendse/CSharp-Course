# NestedIfStatements â€“ Exploring Control Flow in C#

This console application demonstrates the use of nested `if` statements and logical operators in a simple user login simulation. It showcases how multiple conditions can be combined to create detailed user access logic.

## ðŸ’¡ What It Does

- Prompts the user for a username.
- Checks if the user is registered.
- Verifies if the username matches `"admin"` and responds accordingly.
- Uses both `&&` (AND) and `||` (OR) logical operators for condition evaluation.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts

- **Nested `if` statements** for layered condition checking.
- **Logical operators** `&&` and `||`.
- **String comparison** using `.Equals()`.
- Boolean flag handling (`isAdmin`, `isRegistered`).

## ðŸ§ª Example Output

```text
Please enter your username:
admin
Hi there, registered user
Hi there, admin
Hi there, Admin
You are logged in
