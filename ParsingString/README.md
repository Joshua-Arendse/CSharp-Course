# Parsing Strings to Numbers in C#

A C# console application demonstrating how to convert strings to numeric types using parsing methods.

## 🧠 Purpose

- Learn to convert strings to integers and floats using `Parse()`
- Understand the difference between string concatenation and numeric addition
- Handle parsing with culture-specific formats (e.g., commas in floats)

## 📋 What It Does

- Parses two strings representing integers and adds them numerically
- Demonstrates the difference between string concatenation and numeric addition
- Parses a string with a comma decimal (e.g., `"0,85"`) to a float (depending on culture settings)
- Parses a numeric string to an integer and outputs both results

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Language: C#
- Framework: .NET 6 / .NET Core
