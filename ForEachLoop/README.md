# 🔁 ForEachLoop – Looping Through Arrays in C#

This project demonstrates how to use a `foreach` loop to iterate over elements in a string array. It compares repetitive `Console.WriteLine()` calls with the cleaner and more efficient `foreach` loop approach.

---

## 📚 Concepts Practised

- ✅ Arrays of strings
- ✅ Accessing array elements by index
- ✅ Looping with `foreach`
- ✅ Console output formatting

---

## 🧾 Summary

The program:

1. Declares a `string[]` called `weekDays` containing the names of the days of the week.
2. Outputs each element individually using manual `Console.WriteLine()` statements.
3. Repeats the output using a `foreach` loop to show a more scalable, cleaner solution.
