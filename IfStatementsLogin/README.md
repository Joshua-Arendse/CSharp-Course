# IfStatementsLogin – Simple User Authentication

This C# console app simulates a basic user registration and login process using `if` statements. It's a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates how to manage user input and compare stored credentials.

## 🔐 Features

- Register a username and password.
- Prompt user to log in with the registered credentials.
- Compare input against stored values using basic `if` logic.
- Print appropriate success or failure messages.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Static fields** to store username and password across methods.
- **Method separation**: `Register()` and `Login()` functions promote modular code.
- **Control flow** using nested `if` statements.
- Input/output interaction via `Console.ReadLine()` and `Console.WriteLine()`.

## 📌 Sample Output

john
Enter your Password:
1234
Registration completed.
