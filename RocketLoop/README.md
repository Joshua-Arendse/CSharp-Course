# ðŸš€ RocketAnimation â€“ Simple Console Animation in C#

This project simulates a rocket launch countdown using a `for` loop and console animation. It uses string escape characters, `Console.Clear()`, and `Thread.Sleep()` to visually move a rocket "up" the screen with each countdown tick.

## ðŸ“š Concepts Practised

- âœ… `for` loop with countdown logic
- âœ… String escape characters (`\n`, `\r`)
- âœ… ASCII art for visuals
- âœ… `Console.Clear()` to refresh output
- âœ… `Thread.Sleep()` for timing animation
- âœ… Dynamic string manipulation (`rocket = "\n" + rocket`)

## ðŸ§¾ Summary

The program:

1. Displays an ASCII rocket.
2. Uses a countdown loop from 10 to 0.
3. Adds a new line above the rocket each second to simulate vertical movement.
4. Clears the screen on each loop iteration to simulate animation.
5. Prints `"The Rocket has Landed!"` at the end.
