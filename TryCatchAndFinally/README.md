# TryCatchAndFinally – Exception Handling in C#

This project demonstrates how to handle exceptions gracefully using `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks in C#.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Parsing user input
- Handling invalid formats with `FormatException`
- Handling out-of-range numbers with `OverflowException`
- Preventing division by zero with `DivideByZeroException`
- Using the `finally` block to run code regardless of whether an exception occurred

## 📌 Example Behaviour

- Prompts the user to enter a number and safely attempts to parse it.
- Then asks for two numbers and performs division, handling the case where the divisor is zero.
- Demonstrates clean program flow even when errors occur.

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Open the `TryCatchAndFinally` folder in Visual Studio or VS Code.
2. Run using:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
