# Void Methods in C#

This C# console application demonstrates the use of **void methods**, including how to define and call them, with and without parameters.

## 🧠 Purpose

- Learn how to declare and use methods that do not return values (`void`)
- Understand how to pass arguments to methods
- Improve code modularity and readability using method calls

## 📋 What It Does

- Defines and calls two methods:
  - `WriteSomething()` – A basic method with no parameters that writes a static message
  - `WriteSomethingSpecific(string myText)` – A method that accepts a string parameter and prints it
- Demonstrates how methods can be reused and how parameters allow for flexible output
