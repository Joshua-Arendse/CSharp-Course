# IfStatements â€“ Basic Conditional Logic in C#

This simple project demonstrates how conditional logic works in C# using `if`, `else if`, and `else` blocks. It takes the temperature as input from the user and responds with contextually appropriate output.

## ðŸ’¡ What It Does

- Prompts the user to input the current temperature.
- Parses the input string to an integer.
- Compares the temperature to thresholds using `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements.
- Outputs suggestions or messages based on the value.

## ðŸ“˜ Example Output

```text
What is the Temperature today?
8
