# 🔁 CountingLoops – Up and Down with For Loops in C#

This project shows how to use `for` loops in C# to count numbers in both ascending and descending order. It's a simple and essential example for learning loop structure and flow control.

---

## 📚 Concepts Practised

- ✅ `for` loop syntax
- ✅ Loop increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`)
- ✅ Loop boundaries (`<=`, `>=`)
- ✅ Console output with loop variables

---

## 🧾 Summary

The program includes two `for` loops:

1. **Ascending Count:**  
   Counts from 0 to 10 and prints each number.

2. **Descending Count:**  
   Counts from 10 to 0 and prints each number.

## 🧪 Example Output

Counter is 0
Counter is 1
...
Counter is 10
Counter is 10
Counter is 9
...
Counter is 0
