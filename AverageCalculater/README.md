# ðŸ“Š ClassAverageCalculator â€“ Score & Percentage Console App

This project allows teachers (or users) to enter student scores one by one and calculates both the average score and the class percentage based on a user-defined total mark.

---

## ðŸ“š Concepts Practised

- âœ… `do-while` loop for repeated input
- âœ… Sentinel value (`-1`) to exit loop
- âœ… Integer and decimal arithmetic
- âœ… Basic validation logic
- âœ… Percentage calculation
- âœ… Average formula: `sum / count`

## ðŸ§¾ Program Flow

1. Prompts the user for the **total mark** (e.g. 100).
2. Repeatedly asks for student scores.
3. Adds each valid score to a running total until `-1` is entered.
4. Calculates:
   - The average score: `sum / number of students`
   - The percentage: `(average / totalMark) * 100`
5. Displays both results.
