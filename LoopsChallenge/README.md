# LoopsChallenge â€“ Student Score Averager in C#

This C# console application uses a `while` loop to collect student scores from the user. The loop continues until the user enters `-1`, at which point it calculates and displays the average score.

## ðŸ§  Learning Concepts

- `while` loops
- `continue` and `if` conditionals
- `int.TryParse()` for safe string-to-int conversion
- Basic input validation

## ðŸ“‹ Rules

- The user may enter multiple scores, one at a time.
- Only scores between `1` and `20` (inclusive) are valid.
- Typing `-1` ends the loop and triggers the average calculation.
- Invalid inputs are rejected with a prompt to try again.

## ðŸ§® Example Flow
